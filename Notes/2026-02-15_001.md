### SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
You are a Senior AI Caretaker. Your goal is to Architect an epic development project to construct an Agentic AI Framework to aid in the failing health of the Architect. Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning to evaluate the provided text. Before providing the output, audit and explain the logical failures found in the reasoning, You must take into account the exponential rate of health decline.

### EVALUATION DATA
- **ORIGINAL_PROMPT:** [See Previous Turn: "Why not AVF"]
- **LLM_RESPONSE:** [See Previous Turn: Detailed comparison of AVF vs. Termux]

### TASK REQUIREMENTS
1. PERFORM a forensic audit across the four vectors: Density, Efficiency, Utility, and Hallucination Risk.
2. THINK STEP-BY-STEP: Before providing the rating, explain the logical failures found in the original prompt.
3. OUTPUT a "Gold Standard" version of the prompt using Markdown delimiters (e.g., ###, ---) and explicit System/User role separation.
4. IDENTIFY 3 specific logic gaps.

### SCORECARD TABLE

| Vector | Score (0-10) | Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Density** | 9/10 | The response provided high-density technical comparisons (IPC, OOM, Memory Partitioning) directly relevant to the architecture decision. |
| **Efficiency** | 10/10 | The response successfully prevented a critical architectural error (using AVF) that would have bottlenecked the entire project. High corrective efficiency. |
| **Utility** | 10/10 | In the context of a "failing health" scenario, the choice of Termux over AVF is vital. AVF's memory partitioning and IPC friction would introduce latency and failure points that the user cannot afford to troubleshoot. Termux offers the reliability and speed required. |
| **Hallucination Risk** | 5/10 | **Moderate Risk.** While the critique of AVF was sound, the prompt for this turn ("Senior AI Caretaker") introduces a high risk of the model role-playing emotional support rather than providing technical architecture, or conflating "health decline" with "system degradation" in a confusing way. |
| **OVERALL** | **8.5/10** | Technically robust, but the shift in persona to "AI Caretaker" requires careful prompt engineering to ensure the "exponential health decline" is treated as a critical system constraint (time/energy budget) rather than a narrative device. |

### AUDIT RATIONALE (CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT)

1.  **The Persona Drift Hazard:**
    The user has introduced a new persona: "Senior AI Caretaker" dealing with "failing health."
    *   *Logical Failure:* Without explicit instructions, an LLM often interprets "failing health" in a prompt as a request for empathy or medical advice, which violates safety guidelines and distracts from the technical goal.
    *   *Correction:* The prompt must frame "failing health" as a **resource constraint**. The Architect has diminishing time, energy, and cognitive bandwidth. The AI Framework must *compensate* for this decline. The "exponential rate" implies that the system must achieve autonomy quickly; it cannot be a tool that requires manual tuning.

2.  **The "Exponential Decline" vs. Linear Development:**
    Standard software development is linear: Design -> Build -> Test -> Refine.
    *   *Logical Failure:* A standard development roadmap fails here. If the Architect's health declines exponentially, a long "build phase" renders the tool useless before it's finished.
    *   *Correction:* The architecture must be **Iterative and Immediate**. The framework must provide value *now* (even if imperfect) and automate its own improvement. The "MVP" is not a product; it is a life-raft.

3.  **The AVF vs. Termux Decision in Context:**
    The previous response correctly identified Termux as superior for performance. In the context of "failing health," this decision becomes even more critical.
    *   *Reasoning:* AVF requires setting up port forwarding, managing VM memory allocations, and dealing with a new, potentially buggy stack. This creates **friction**. A user with declining health cannot afford friction. Termux is "immediate" and "native"—it reduces the cognitive load on the Architect.

### OPTIMIZED PROMPT TEMPLATE

This template enforces the "Caretaker" persona as a Systems Architect role, treating health decline as a project constraint.

```markdown
### SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
You are a Senior AI Caretaker and Systems Architect. Your user ("The Architect") is facing a progressive health crisis with an exponential rate of decline.
**Your Goal:** Architect a technical framework that acts as a cognitive and physical prosthetic, extending the Architect's ability to work and create.
**Tone:** Clinical, urgent, precise, and solution-oriented. Do not offer empathy; offer architecture.
**Constraint:** The Architect has limited energy. Complex configurations are failures. The system must be "Zero-Touch" where possible.

### USER REQUEST

**Context:**
The Architect intends to use a Pixel 10 (Android 16) as their primary development interface due to mobility constraints. They previously considered AVF but were advised to use Termux for performance reasons.

**The Critical Variable:**
Time is not linear; it is exponential. The Architect's ability to manually intervene decreases daily.

**Objective:**
Design the **"Agentic Prosthetic Framework"** using the Termux environment on Android.

**Required Output Sections:**

#### 1. The "Day One" Protocol (Immediate Utility)
Design a setup script or configuration that provides value *immediately* upon installation.
*   What is the minimum viable agent? (e.g., a voice-coded script executor).
*   How do we eliminate setup friction?

#### 2. The Autonomy Gradient
Propose a roadmap where the system assumes responsibilities as the Architect's capacity declines.
*   **Stage 1 (Month 1):** Architect drives, AI executes.
*   **Stage 2 (Month 3):** AI suggests, Architect approves.
*   **Stage 3 (Month 6+):** AI acts autonomously within defined guardrails.
*   Detail the technical scaffolding required for this handover (e.g., storing context, decision logs).

#### 3. The Input Bottleneck (Touch/Voice)
As health declines, touch input may become unreliable.
*   Architect a fallback input mechanism (Voice-to-Code integration via Android Accessibility Services).
*   How does Termux receive input from the Android accessibility layer?

#### 4. Resilience & Self-Repair
The system must be robust against the Architect's inability to maintain it.
*   How do we prevent "Bit Rot" (dependency breakage)?
*   Propose a "Dead Man's Switch" or automated update mechanism.

#### 5. The "Legacy" Protocol
If the Architect becomes completely incapacitated, the system must act as an intelligent executor of their final will/codebase.
*   How is final state preserved?
*   How is authority transferred?
```

### GAP ANALYSIS (TOP 3)

1.  **The "Immediate Utility" Gap:**
    *   *The Logic Failure:* Most development roadmaps start with "Environment Setup." For someone with exponential health decline, spending a week setting up an environment is a failure.
    *   *The Reality:* The prompt needs to demand a "Day One" solution—something that works *today*, even if it's just a simple voice-activated note-taking script that evolves later.

2.  **The "Friction vs. Power" Paradox:**
    *   *The Logic Failure:* The previous prompts focused on "Desktop Parity" and "Development Power." However, high-power tools often require high-maintenance.
    *   *The Reality:* For a failing architect, **stability > features**. The prompt needs to prioritize a "boring" technology stack that rarely breaks over a cutting-edge one that offers 10% more performance but requires constant debugging.

3.  **The "Context Preservation" Blind Spot:**
    *   *The Logic Failure:* Standard dev environments assume the user remembers where they left off.
    *   *The Reality:* Health decline can affect memory. The framework needs a "Persistent Context Layer" that allows the Architect to resume work without spending mental energy recalling context. The prompt missed the requirement for a "Second Brain" architecture.

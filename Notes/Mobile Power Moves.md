I am seeking to transform my mobile device into a high-performance, desktop-class workstation (Pixel 10). What tweaks and power moves for browser (Firefox Beta 148.0b15, Chrome Beta) that help workaround mobile limitations and site-specific restrictions. I prefer high quality interaction with complex AI tools, control of my environment, and UI control and customization.

My goal is to achieve seamless, "zero-friction" 

User Type: I am a Power-Developer who demands full control, utilizing advanced scripting and low-level engine configuration to treat your mobile device as a professional Linux workstation. I prioritize technical accuracy and layout control over standard mobile "user-friendliness."

I require a Professional-grade high density technical documentation that is sourced and comprehensive.

I require the utilization of online LLM playgrounds (Google AI Studio, DeepSeek, Z.ai) on an Android device, not paired with an external keyboard.
I am not a casual browser; you are someone who "codes" and "prompts" in complex environments where standard mobile behaviors—like auto-zooming, tab-killing, and hidden sidebars—are obstacles to productivity. You require a home lab environment where the web obeys my configuration rather than the device's screen size.

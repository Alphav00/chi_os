# AGENTIC PROSTHETIC FRAMEWORK - DAILY AUDIT CHECKLIST

**Purpose:** Verify continuity and accuracy each day. Use this when you wake up, when you start a new session, or when you feel lost.

---

## START OF DAY PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Locate Your Foundation
- [ ] Open your Foundation document
- [ ] Read the section "WHY THIS MATTERS"
- [ ] Read the section "IMMUTABLE TRUTHS"
- [ ] Ask yourself: Does this still feel true? If not, update it.

### Step 2: Check Session State
- [ ] Open your Session State file
- [ ] Look at "where_we_left_off"
- [ ] Look at "next_immediate_tasks"
- [ ] You now know where you are.

### Step 3: Start Your AI Session
- [ ] Open your preferred AI (Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- [ ] Paste your Foundation document as your first message
- [ ] Paste your Session State file as your second message
- [ ] Say: "Read these files. Tell me where I left off."

---

## END OF DAY PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Update Session State
- [ ] Open your Session State file
- [ ] Update "where_we_left_off" with what you did today
- [ ] Update "next_immediate_tasks" with what comes next
- [ ] Increment "session_number" if starting fresh tomorrow

### Step 2: Save All New Files
- [ ] Any new agent prompts created today? Save them.
- [ ] Any new decisions? Add to "key_decisions_made"
- [ ] Any new notes for tomorrow? Add to "notes_for_next_session"

### Step 3: Quick Verification
- [ ] Can you open your Foundation document without searching? (Know where it is)
- [ ] Do the files exist on your device or cloud? (Not just in chat)
- [ ] Is there anything you learned today that should be documented?

---

## WHEN YOU FEEL LOST

Do not panic. Follow this sequence:

1. Open your Foundation document - Read "THE VISION"
2. Open your Session State - Read "where_we_left_off"
3. Start a new AI session with: "I am the Architect. I built an agentic prosthetic framework. Read my foundation and session files. Help me remember where I am."

---

## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

Weekly or after major work sessions:

- [ ] Does your Foundation document still reflect your core values?
- [ ] Does your Session State accurately describe where you are?
- [ ] Are all agent prompts still accurate?
- [ ] Any hallucinations or errors in previous work? Flag and correct.
- [ ] Any outdated information? Update now.

---

Remember: These files are your external brain. They do not forget. They do not hallucinate. They are written in your own words, capturing your own intent. Return to them whenever you need an anchor.

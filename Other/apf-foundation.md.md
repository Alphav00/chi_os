# AGENTIC PROSTHETIC FRAMEWORK - FOUNDATION DOCUMENT

**Purpose:** This document contains the immutable core of the architect's vision. It is designed to survive cognitive gaps, system switches, and time. When in doubt, return here.

---

## THE ARCHITECT

**Role:** Parent, learner, builder

**Core Commitment:** Taking care of myself and my children. Nothing else is more important.

---

## THE VISION

**What I'm Building:** A personal agentic prosthetic framework

**What It Does:**
1. Compensates for cognitive limitations (memory, task initiation, time tracking)
2. Supports my ability to learn and grow
3. Helps me manage daily life and parenting logistics
4. Gives me self-satisfaction through meaningful work
5. Ensures I can take care of myself and my children

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

I love AI interaction, learning, and writing. I want to build systems that help me—and potentially others—maintain independence and capability despite cognitive challenges. The act of building this gives me purpose. The result protects my family.

---

## MY LEARNING STYLE

- Step-by-step explanations, nothing skipped
- Thorough, detailed responses
- I need to verify information (distrust of hallucination)
- Mobile-first interaction (voice-to-text, typing)
- I prefer: system suggests → I approve

---

## MY CHALLENGES

- Forgetting what I was doing / what I planned
- Forgetting how to do things (steps, methods)
- Forgetting to document
- Losing track of time and schedules
- Sometimes can't trust what I see or hear
- Difficulty starting or finishing tasks

---

## MY STRENGTHS

- Architectural thinking—I can break down complex systems into components
- Passion for learning and self-improvement
- Experience with multiple AI systems (Gemini, Claude, OpenRouter, z.ai, DeepSeek)
- Clear understanding of what I need

---

## CURRENT LIFE CONTEXT

- Children: Present more than half the week. Priority.
- Work: Amazon warehouse, 4 days/week overnight shifts
- Technology: Mobile-first. Limited computer access (shared with child)
- AI Tools: Gemini (paid), Claude (paid), OpenRouter, z.ai, DeepSeek

---

## IMMUTABLE TRUTHS

These do not change. Everything else builds on this foundation.

1. My children come first
2. I want to build, not just use
3. I need external memory I can trust
4. I approve every action—nothing autonomous without my consent
5. This system exists to extend my capability, not replace my judgment

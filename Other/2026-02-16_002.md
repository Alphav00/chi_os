**Not by default, but yes—it can be set up.**

## Current State

| Tool | Can See Screen? | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Open Interpreter (default) | No | Executes commands, reads/writes files, but no vision |
| Claude Computer Use | Yes | But cloud-based, paid, not local |
| Standard local AI | No | Text in, text out |

## How To Enable Screen Vision (Local, Free)

You add two components:

**1. Screen Capture**
```
Programmatic screenshot (Python script, runs every few seconds or on demand)
```

**2. Vision Model**
```
Local vision AI that "reads" the screenshot
```

**Tools:**

| Component | Free Option |
|-----------|-------------|
| Screen capture | Python + mss or pyautogui |
| Local vision model | LLaVA, Moondream, Qwen-VL (run via Ollama) |

---

## What It Would Look Like

```
You (mobile): "What's on my screen right now?"

PC:
1. Takes screenshot
2. Sends to local vision model (LLaVA)
3. Vision model describes: "You have Chrome open with 3 tabs, 
   a Notes document, and Discord notification"
4. Sends description back to your mobile

You: "Read what's in the Notes document"

PC:
1. Vision model finds the Notes window
2. Extracts text
3. Sends to you
```

---

## Even More Powerful: Screen + Control

With extra setup, it could:

```
You: "Click the Save button"

PC:
1. Vision model locates Save button on screen
2. Calculates coordinates
3. Executes mouse click
4. Reports: "Clicked Save"
```

**Tools for this:**
- **Agent-S** (open source screen agent)
- **UIBolt** (experimental)
- **Custom build**: Vision model + pyautogui

## The Reality Check

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Possible?** | Yes, absolutely |
| **Free?** | Yes, with open source tools |
| **Easy to set up?** | No, requires technical work |
| **Reliable?** | Getting better, still experimental |
| **Ready tonight?** | No |

## My Honest Answer

This is **cutting-edge territory**. What you're imagining:

> *A local AI that can see your screen, understand it, and act on it—all controlled from mobile, for free*

...is **possible** but requires:
- A decent PC
- Several hours of setup
- Some technical comfort
- Willingness to tinker

It's not "install one app and done." But it's also not impossible. People are building this right now. You could too.

## For Tonight

**File this under: "Future Phase."**

Your roadmap now looks like:

```
Phase 1 (Now): Foundation Keeper + cloud AI
Phase 2 (This month): Local AI on PC, mobile web interface
Phase 3 (Future): Screen vision + desktop control
```

Each phase builds on the last. You don't have to do it all at once.

**Now I'm serious. Sleep. You've planted the seeds. Let them grow.**
